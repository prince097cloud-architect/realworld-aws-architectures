Practical AWS architecture blueprints with a learning-by-building approach.
# Real-World AWS Infrastructure Scenarios

This repository documents a series of **real-world AWS infrastructure architectures**, explored through hands-on implementations, best practices, and architectural decision-making.

It is designed to help engineers and architects **learn by building**, while creating reusable blueprints for **secure, scalable, and production-grade cloud infrastructure**.

> 🚀 This is a learning-in-public series — focused on building infrastructure patterns seen in real-world AWS environments.

## 🌐 What's Inside?

Each folder represents a **complete infrastructure scenario** inspired by real use cases from modern cloud-native environments.

| Part | Scenario | Description |
|------|----------|-------------|
| 01 | `secure-infra-bootstrap` | Set up secure access patterns using modern authentication mechanisms (e.g., OIDC, IAM roles) |
| 02 | `centralized-eks-msk-rds` | Deploy EKS, MSK, and RDS in a shared services VPC following centralized networking and access control |
| 03 | `cross-account-deployment` | Use IAM roles and trust policies to deploy workloads across AWS accounts securely |
| 04 | `policy-as-code-controls` | Enforce infrastructure standards using policy tools (e.g., Sentinel, OPA) |
| 05 | `service-deployment-on-eks` | Build, package, and deploy a microservice on EKS using best practices for networking, observability, and IAM |

## 🎯 Objectives

- Build practical, reusable AWS infrastructure blueprints  
- Explore secure access patterns and IAM role strategies  
- Learn how to scale infra for real-world environments  
- Apply design principles like least privilege, modularity, and DR  
- Understand trade-offs behind each architectural decision  

---

## 🧱 Technologies Covered

While this repo is tooling-agnostic, common components include:

- AWS Core Services (EKS, RDS, MSK, VPC, IAM, CloudWatch)
- Infrastructure-as-Code (e.g., Terraform, Helm, CDK)
- Federated Access (OIDC, IAM roles, SSO)
- Policy-as-Code tools (e.g., Sentinel, OPA)
- CI/CD integration patterns
- Multi-account and cross-environment strategies

---
